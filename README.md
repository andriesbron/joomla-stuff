# Stuff for Joomla!

Currently work in progress.

## Content plugins

### iopmediachannel
Uses hls.js to display a hls video in a nice top sticking container.

Usage (demonstrates a .m4v video, but hls is actually the goal to display):

{iop_mediachannel type="video" src="http://mirror.cessen.com/blender.org/peach/trailer/trailer_iphone.m4v"}Dummy text{/iop}

### iopmag
Can be used to create quoted items and magazine like boxes inside your text. I am still working on this. expecting to provide some usage later, otherwise check the code for usage.
